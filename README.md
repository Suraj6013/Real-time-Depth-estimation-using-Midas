Real-time Depth Estimation with MiDaS.

This repository contains a Python script for real-time depth estimation using the MiDaS (Monocular Depth Estimation in the Wild with Convolutional Networks) model. The script captures video input from a webcam in real-time, processes each frame through the MiDaS model, and displays the original video along with the corresponding depth map.

Features
MiDaS Depth Estimation: Utilizes the MiDaS model for monocular depth estimation, providing accurate depth maps for each frame of the input video.
Real-time Processing: The script processes webcam input in real-time, allowing users to visualize depth information as the video feed is captured.
FPS Display: The frames per second (FPS) are displayed on the original video feed, providing information about the processing speed.
Color-Mapped Depth Visualization: The depth maps are color-mapped for better visualization, using the 'Magma' colormap.
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-depth-estimation.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python depth_estimation.py
Requirements
